[safe_z_home]
home_xy_position: 110,110
#   A X,Y coordinate (e.g. 100,100) where the Z homing should be
#   performed. This parameter must be provided.
speed: 50
#   Speed at which the toolhead is moved to the safe Z home
#   coordinate. The default is 50 mm/s
z_hop: 5
#   Distance (in mm) to lift the Z axis prior to homing. This is
#   applied to any homing command, even if it doesn't home the Z axis.
#   If the Z axis is already homed and the current Z position is less
#   than z_hop, then this will lift the head to a height of z_hop. If
#   the Z axis is not already homed the head is lifted by z_hop.
#   The default is to not implement Z hop.
z_hop_speed: 50
#   Speed (in mm/s) at which the Z axis is lifted prior to homing. The
#   default is 20mm/s.
move_to_previous: False
#   When set to True, xy are reset to their previous positions after z
#   homing. The default is False.

#[homing_override]
# gcode:
#   A list of G-Code commands to execute in place of G28 commands
#   found in the normal g-code input. See docs/Command_Templates.md
#   for G-Code format. If a G28 is contained in this list of commands
#   then it will invoke the normal homing procedure for the printer.
#   The commands listed here must home all axes. This parameter must
#   be provided.
#axes: xyz
#   The axes to override. For example, if this is set to "z" then the
#   override script will only be run when the z axis is homed (eg, via
#   a "G28" or "G28 Z0" command). Note, the override script should
#   still home all axes. The default is "xyz" which causes the
#   override script to be run in place of all G28 commands.
#set_position_x:
#set_position_y:
#set_position_z:
#   If specified, the printer will assume the axis is at the specified
#   position prior to running the above g-code commands. Setting this
#   disables homing checks for that axis. This may be useful if the
#   head must move prior to invoking the normal G28 mechanism for an
#   axis. The default is to not force a position for an axis.

# [endstop_phase stepper_z]
#endstop_accuracy:
#   Sets the expected accuracy (in mm) of the endstop. This represents
#   the maximum error distance the endstop may trigger (eg, if an
#   endstop may occasionally trigger 100um early or up to 100um late
#   then set this to 0.200 for 200um). The default is
#   4*rotation_distance/full_steps_per_rotation.
#trigger_phase:
#   This specifies the phase of the stepper motor driver to expect
#   when hitting the endstop. It is composed of two numbers separated
#   by a forward slash character - the phase and the total number of
#   phases (eg, "7/64"). Only set this value if one is sure the
#   stepper motor driver is reset every time the mcu is reset. If this
#   is not set, then the stepper phase will be detected on the first
#   home and that phase will be used on all subsequent homes.
#endstop_align_zero: False
#   If true then the position_endstop of the axis will effectively be
#   modified so that the zero position for the axis occurs at a full
#   step on the stepper motor. (If used on the Z axis and the print
#   layer height is a multiple of a full step distance then every
#   layer will occur on a full step.) The default is False.
